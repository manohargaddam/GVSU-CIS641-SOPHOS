# Introduction

The central idea of the project is to create a Retro Board Application, a digital tool that will revolutionize how agile teams in the organization conduct retrospectives. This project aims to close that gap by providing a centralized platform for streamlining and improving the retrospective process.

The application's core functionality will be to facilitate the creation and management of retrospective boards by providing teams with an intuitive interface to input feedback, categorize issues, and collaboratively vote on the most critical issues. This digital solution aims to replace time-consuming manual methods with a simple, user-friendly tool.
